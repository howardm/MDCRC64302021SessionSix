.big[.blue[Objectives]

.blue[Part I]

* Evaluate and compare the nature of the patient-physician and investigator-subject relationship
* Explore the nature of role-based obligations in these relationships
* Explore whether, in clinical research, physicians can simultaneously discharge the obligations of physician and investigator


.blue[Part II]

* Discern ethical considerations when sponsors and investigators perform clinical research in low- and middle-income countries
* Explore the notions of social value and the responsiveness requirement in such international research]

.big[.blue[Consider a scenario:]

A patient with metastatic breast cancer is referred to Dr. Jones. She is aware that high-dose chemotherapy with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is being touted as a promising new treatment and plans to request it. Dr. Jones believes the biological rationale is plausible and has recently used it in two patients. After evaluating the patient, he decides she is a reasonable candidate for the therapy and proposes it to her.

Is his management recommendation consistent with competent medical care ?]

.big[.blue[A scenario with a thought experiment:]

A patient with metastatic breast cancer is referred to Dr. Jones. She has heard that high-dose chemotherapy with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is being touted as a promising new treatment. You are her friend. She asks you whether she should ask her for this treatment. You reply that you are aware that a survey (conducted under the auspices of the main oncology professional society) of practising oncology members about their views of this treatment has just been published. Sixty percent of the responding oncologists believe the treatment to be superior to current standard therapy and plan to use it for some of their patients. How would you advise her?]

.big[.blue[What about this different scenario ?]

A patient with metastatic breast cancer is referred to Dr. Jones. She is aware that high-dose chemotherapy with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is being touted as a promising new treatment and plans to request it. Dr. Jones believes the biological rationale is plausible and has recently used it in two patients.  

He is aware that other oncologists have questioned the evidential warrant for the therapy, and that a RCT comparing it to standard therapy has just been initiated in his medical center. He has agreed to be the local P.I. for the protocol.

If he believes she meets the eligibility criteria (inclusion and exclusion) but decides .purple[*not*] to mention the availability of the trial to her, is this decision unethical ? ]

.pull-left[.blue[Case for discussion]

A U.S. - based company proposes to conduct a trial of a new surfactant drug used to treat premature newborns at risk of developing respiratory distress syndrome. The Sponsor does not necessarily anticipate that the agent will be superior to FDA-approved agents currently available in the U.S. But production of this agent is relatively simple, and may translate into a cheaper product. The proposed trial is designed as a placebo-controlled trial. 

Because synthetic surfactant is not routinely available in many resource-poor countries, the trial will be conducted in four particular Latin American countries, and specific hospitals in certain regions where synthetic surfactant is ostensibly never used will be targeted for recruitment.

.pull-right[.blue[Questions]


Is the conduct of a placebo-controlled trial in these countries ethical ?

Are there alternative research designs that would better meet requirements for ethical research in these countries ?


Would the conduct of the trial be [per se] exploitative ?

Does the research address important health needs in the host communities ?

What might “post-trial provision..” mean in this research ?
